# A Mozilla Club At Your Community Meet-Up

> Mix-up your meet-up by adding hands-on activities that get your participants making and learning the web together!

You meet regularly/semi-regularly with a group of individuals who come together around common interests or topics. Perhaps they are adults or young professionals coming together for general networking, or to build and develop new skills. With Mozilla Clubs, you can connect your community to a global initiative, using participatory practices and bringing peer-learning into your existing meet-up structure. 

**Mozilla Clubs add value to your meet-ups** by:
* Bringing elements of reading, writing and participating on the web into your context, and connecting topics your community cares about with engaging, hands-on learning activities that teach how to read, write and participate on the web
* Providing opportunities for participants to make, learn and get to know one another
* Strengthening your community by connecting with a global mission while planting local roots for positive social impact

**Mozilla Clubs motivate your meet-up attendees** by:
* Learning new web skills, including how to read, write and participate on the web
* Empowering others (in their school, workplace, community, etc.) to see the web as a global platform for creativity and sharing
* Joining a global community with a mission






## How and why you should incorporate Mozilla Clubs into your meet-up

As a meet-up host, or Mozilla Club Captain in this context, you can:
* Uplevel your own mentoring skills.
* Create or adapt activities that are focused on the same things your community cares about.
* Join a global network and connect with other Mozilla Club Captains to share best practices and contribute new/adapted content.

**It’s easy to get started!** Introduce Mozilla Clubs activities at your regular meet-up and adapt them to your groups’ interests. We recommend starting with the Web Literacy Basics module, which is comprised of six activities, each approximately 45 minutes in length.
The activities make great ice breakers, with the added benefit of learning new skills.
Try a “Read, Write, Participate” theme for your meet-up for one month (or for a season) and facilitate one activity at each meet-up during that timeframe.
Encourage participants to try the activities together and then to teach them to others before your next meet-up.
