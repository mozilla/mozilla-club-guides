# Technical background about this system

This is a change from the previous layout and system. Its using a combination of JS libraries to render a markdown based guide file as HTML without requiring any server side processing. This new layout is responsive and adapts to any device and is more friendly to readers. We also have a new **reading options** screen where the reader can set their own font face and size to better suit their preferences.
