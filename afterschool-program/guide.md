# A Mozilla Club In Your Afterschool Program

## What
The Mozilla Club is an opportunity to regularly bring digital literacy skills into the afterschool environment and participate in a global community of teachers and learners.  Afterschool programs are the ideal setting for afterschool educators and participants to teach and learn digital literacy skills adapting the Mozilla Club curriculum. Mozilla is a non-profit public charity best known for Firefox, and whose mission is to develop free open source, remixable tools and resources for universal web literacy. By engaging with Mozilla Clubs, afterschool programs can connect to a global community, and using participatory practices and project based learning. 

## Why
* Connect with hands-on learning activities where afterschool educators and participants learn how to read, write, and participate on the Web, teach others, and learn together.  
* Empower afterschool educators with professional development opportunities that will continually bring them up to speed on the latest web literacy skills. 
* Combine these web literacy skills with current and new projects that are on and off-line. 
* Strengthen  your afterschool program by teaching core web literacy skills to students that will enhance in-school learning and STEM skills.

## Who
* Any afterschool provider interested in learning web literacy skills to help facilitate positive experiences in their programs, and create new and innovative  hands-on activities. 

## How 
* Mozilla Club curriculum can be incorporated into existing programming over a month, a 6-8 week period or a weeklong  summer camp module, or during professional development days.

## It’s easy to get started!

At your next staff meeting, share the Mozilla Clubs activities and determine how to adapt the activities to your afterschool program.  The Web Literacy Basics module, which is comprised of six activities, each approximately 45 minutes in length are a great way to start and easily adaptable for your particular age group.

* The activities make great ice breakers, with the added benefit of learning new skills.
* Participants can try these activities together, and a takeaway assignment could be to teach to their parents or other adults in their lives as part of a project. 

We’re here to help you through the process of embedding a Mozilla Club . 
* **Materials:** We have materials available online at teach.mozilla.org/activities  
* **Individual support:**  When you start a Mozilla Club, you’ll be assigned a Regional Coordinator whose main responsibility is to help you get set up,  find the most relevant resource, and provide support. 
* **Peer support:**  An online forum (discourse) provides an opportunity to learn from others across the world using Mozilla Club curriculum. You can  ask questions, share challenges or successes, or connect with others who have incorporated into their afterschool program.
