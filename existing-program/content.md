# A Mozilla Club In Your Established Program


**How Mozilla Clubs can add an educational dynamic to your already established club meet up.**

**Do you already run  a weekly or monthly meet up in a club setting?** Mozilla Clubs are designed so that they can be used as a compliment to your existing structure without changing the nature of your group. You can embed a web literacy club in your programming  without losing your club’s identity.

Do you already have a program running such as summer camp, teen leadership summit, or local community meeting up? A gathering of young adults who want to learning new digital skills that enables better jobs and opportunities, or an older generation eager to learn new skills and understand how the internet work.

## Why
Teach like mozilla offers curriculum you can teach on a regular basis to your club attendees that can add great educational benefits to your existing club agenda. Mozilla clubs is offering web literacy tools and resources which can be used to further skills in reading, writing and participation on the web.


## How
As an established club you already have a classroom of learners whether you meet in the local library, community centre or around the kitchen table. You have an established group with work together with an invested goal.  Mozilla clubs can be an added dynamic to your meet up, providing activities with a clear goal and outcome around digital education.

Sarah, from London runs a MozLdN event in her work place once a month, she holds scratch lessons, HTML workshops and now includes Mozilla Clubs curriculum within the 3 hours meet up agenda.


> “ I was running a local meet up at the weekends for young adults between the ages of 10-15 yrs of age and I already had a format that was working for the day- 
>My club not only caters to a wide range of ages but also a wide range of levels so I wanted to include additional curriculum into the Club where some kids who wanted to learn more and apply the skills they picked up via Scratch or HTML and could see these skills applied in other areas of the web.
>I started by dipping  into the Grab and Go curriculum on the teach.mozilla.org site but I soon realised by applying the curriculum plan I also applying a metric to the lessons- I could see the childrens skill advancing over the 6 weeks I taught the preplanned curriculum.
>
>The support is great- I would never consider myself hugely technical or with great digital skills but each lesson had a great support structure behind the lesson where I could read the discourse conversation, note the advice other teachers gave who had previous tried and tested the lesson with a variety of age groups and levels.
>The lessons are laid out in a format that is easy to apply on the day without much remixing needed.
>
>The kids work with me on the 6 week program, we both learn new skills that can be applied elsewhere within our club agenda. “
